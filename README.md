# godot_4x_camera
A simple 4X style camera controller for the Godot game engine.

```
You must define these actions in your Input Map. If yout don't, nothing will happen. 
You don't have to call them what is listed here, but if you don't then you have to change the 
definitions below to match what you label them in the input Map. Probably best to just use 
these names, unless you really want them to be called something different.

export var ACTION_NAME_CAMERA_MOVE_LEFT = "CameraMoveLeft"
export var ACTION_NAME_CAMERA_MOVE_RIGHT = "CameraMoveRight"
export var ACTION_NAME_CAMERA_MOVE_UP = "CameraMoveUp"
export var ACTION_NAME_CAMERA_MOVE_DOWN = "CameraMoveDown"
export var ACTION_NAME_CAMERA_ROTATE = "CameraRotate"
export var ACTION_NAME_CAMERA_ZOOM_IN = "CameraZoomIn"
export var ACTION_NAME_CAMERA_ZOOM_OUT = "CameraZoomOut"
export var ACTION_NAME_CAMERA_RESET = "CameraReset"
export var ACTION_NAME_CAMERA_RAISE = "CameraRaise"
export var ACTION_NAME_CAMERA_LOWER = "CameraLower"
```
